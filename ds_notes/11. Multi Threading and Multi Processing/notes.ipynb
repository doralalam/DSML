    "1. Program:\n",
    "\n",
    "    A Program is a sequence of instructions written in any programming language. Ex: Python, C, C++, Java\n",
    "\n",
    "    Example: MS Paints is a windows application (with .exe file), which is also known as Program, that helps us to draw some painting\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Process:\n",
    "\n",
    "    A process is an instance of a program that is being executed\n",
    "\n",
    "    Example: When we double click on the MS Paint app icon on the desktop, it will open the application which is known as process\n",
    "\n",
    "    1. Multiple processes use separate memory space. Each process will have separate ID\n",
    "\n",
    "    2. So, one process cannot corrupt the other process\n",
    "\n",
    "    3. The disadvantage with multiple processes is that, if a process requires IO device related operations, then switching between these processes will increase the execution time\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Thread:\n",
    "\n",
    "    A thread is a unit of execution with in the process\n",
    "\n",
    "    Example: In the MS Paints application, if we open it, the process will begin and then we will start drawinig by selecting a rectangle, or a circle etc., which is known as thread\n",
    "\n",
    "    Selecting a rectangle is a unit of execution within the process which is known as Thread\n",
    "\n",
    "    Threads are of two types:\n",
    "\n",
    "    1. Single Threaded Process\n",
    "\n",
    "    2. Multi Threaded Process\n"
